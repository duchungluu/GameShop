GameShop is a web site or buying, selling and playing browser based games. It was developed as a part of web software development course in a three man team including me, Juha Suokas and Atro Himanen.

My responsibilities in this project were:
* User interface and user experience (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery)
* Our own browser game (Javascript and pixi.js)
* Misc backend logic functionalities (Python, Django)
